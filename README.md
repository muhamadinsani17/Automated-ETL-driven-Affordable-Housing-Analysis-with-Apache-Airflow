# Automated-ETL-driven-Affordable-Housing-Analysis-with-Apache-Airflow

## Background
### Problem Statement
In the context of urban development, affordable housing is a primary concern. This report aims to identify patterns to support decision-makers in urban planning and efficient, sustainable property development. Construction projects have a significant impact on city transformation, and understanding the dynamics behind it is crucial to achieve a balance between urban growth and the availability of affordable housing.


### Objectives
To understand the impacts of construction projects in order to make better decisions and have a positive impact on local communities.


## Results
Exploration of the data shows the success of the construction project in creating inclusionary housing with a focus on low and middle income segments. Sustainable business strategies can be improved by emphasizing income diversity and potential locations. 

These findings align with a study by the Urban Land Institute (ULI) in 2019, highlighting the economic benefits of affordable housing.
